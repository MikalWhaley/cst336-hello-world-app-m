           The original Linux kernal can be traced back to 1991, where Linus Torvalds was a university student in Finland. He publically posted about his project, and received support for his project, where he was able to create a functioning kernal. Linux did not find the same general success in the same way that Windows or macOS did. It is considered Unix-like but lacks and real Unix code. While Linux doesn't even make up 2% of all desktop PC's it has been largley adopted for server use, and other proprietary devices such as smart watches. The final and more practical use for Linux is its adoption for use on many smartphones, and its use on supercomputers.
