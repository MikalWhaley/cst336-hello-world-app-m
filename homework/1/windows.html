                <p> Windows has been Microsoft's primary operating system since 1985. Begining as an enviornment for the then current MS-DOS. Later on when Windows 95 was released, MS-DOS became just the bootstrap. A program called Win9x could use and run a real-mode MS-DOS, for backwards compatibility. Windows would later branch out from traditional operating systems into things like server operating systems. Windows had a huge share on the personal computer market, with its large percentage of aformentioned internet connected machines, but server software would prove difficult for them to get into. Linux and BSD are well established in the server marketplace.  </p>
                <br/>
                <p>In recent years Windows has contiuned to update, with the most recent being Windows 7 in 2009, Windows 8 in 2012, and Windows 10 in 2015. Each of the main series Windows releases have some sort of new gimic attached to it. Windows 7 was a direct responce to the backlash against Windows Vista, and cleaned up all of its common erros, and cleaned up the aethstetic. Windows 8 changed the long time start bar to a menu, and advertized the ability to save setttings to the cloud and carry them over to new machines. Windows 10 came pre-loaded with Cortana who is a personal voice assistant similar to Apple's Siri, and a redesigned Internet Explorer named Microsoft Edge.</p>
