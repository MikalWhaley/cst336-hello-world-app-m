                    macOS is an open core graphical operating system developed by Apple Inc. It is pre loaded on all of Apple's Macintosh computers. The original Mac OS originated in 1984 and was Apple's main OS until its successor macOS, a UNIX based operating system took its place after being developed in the mid 80's. The newer macOS wouldn't be released until 1999 with the release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, and then finally a normal user client with Mac OS X Cheetah. Before the two operating services were merged, the server version of the operating systems's were visually identical, with the latter having some special tools for server managment. Later these additions would be added to the regular macOS releases.
